# dt-python-scripts


Here is a collection of Python scripts that i have made and wish to share with other people.

These scripts are used in my streams and are aimed to fill a gap where i wasent able to find one to suite my needs.

All scripts are tested on Linux and as such guarenteed to work on that platform. However you are welcome to fork this repo and edit any of the scripts to make it work on Windows.


# Licence:

You are free to copy/use/edit/share these scripts all i ask is that you give credit to me if you reshare my work and of coarse i would love to see what changes you have made and any improvements you have intergrated into them, so be sure to share them with me.

(If you share these scripts then you MUST do so for FREE. You are NOT allowed to charge any form of fee, doing so breaks the licence)
